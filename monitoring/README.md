# Monitoring Fluent Bit with Grafana Stack

Simple example of running up Prometheus, Loki and Grafana (PLG) stack to receive observability data (logs and metrics) from Fluent Bit.

Run up the stack with `run.sh` (or use docker compose directly) then browse to https://localhost:3000 to interact with Grafana.
